## Quality of Life Index (QLI) for South American Countries: A Focus on Migrants

This project aims to develop a **Quality of Life Index (QLI)** to help **migrants in South America** make informed relocation decisions. The QLI aggregates multiple dimensions such as **economic opportunities, safety, healthcare, education, and social conditions** to provide a comparative ranking of countries. 

### Research Question

**How can we create a Quality of Life Index to facilitate comparisons among South American countries and support migrant populations in choosing destinations that meet their specific needs?**

### Data Sources
- **World Bank:** Economic indicators, governance metrics, and health statistics.
- **CEPAL:** Regional migration, labor market, and social data.

### Methodology

1. **Data Standardization**
2. **Dimension Scoring**
3. **Overall QLI Calculation**
4. **Customization Feature using Shiny Dashboard**

### Repository Structure
- **data**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **shiny-app**: Code for the interactive dashboard.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for reproducibility.
- **Writeup**: Final report in .qmd, .html, and .pdf formats.

### Findings
- **Southern Cone countries (Uruguay, Argentina, Chile) rank higher.**
- **Andean countries face more economic and social challenges.**
- **Customization allows migrants to prioritize factors.**

### Limitations
- **Data gaps for some indicators.**
- **Country-level focus may not capture city-level differences.**
- **Legal barriers affect migration choices.**

### How to Use
1. Run the Python scripts to process data.
2. Compute QLI rankings.
3. Use the **Shiny dashboard** for interactive analysis.
